# ExtendedValidationMoreTest

This unit test compares the DST transitions calculated by the
`ExtendedZoneSpecifier` class with the `validation_data.cpp` file generated by
the Java `../../tools/java/TestDataGenerator.java` program. The
`validation_data.cpp` file was generated using
```
$ make validation_data
```

The Java program generates about 260,000 data points spanning the year 2000 to
2050. It is too large to run on any Arduino board that I am aware of, including
the ESP32.

The unit test does run on a Linux machine using the
[unitduino](https://github.com/bxparks/AUnit/tree/develop/unitduino) adaptor
layer included with [AUnit](https://github.com/bxparks/AUnit). Assuming that you
have `g++` and `make` installed, just type:
```
$ make
$ ./ExtendedValidationMoreTest.out
